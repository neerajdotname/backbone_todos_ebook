== step 1 : Getting started

We will start with barebone html markup. No JavaScritp is being used. The html code is given below.


[source,html]
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Backbone Demo: Todos in steps</title>
    <link href="todos.css" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="todoapp">
      <div class="title">
        <h1>Todos in steps</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <div id="create-todo">
          <input id="new-todo" placeholder="What needs to be done?" type="text" />
          <span class="ui-tooltip-top" style="display:none;">Press Enter to save this task</span>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>

With the above html code and given css the page looks like this

And sub-sub-sections of each chapter.

You can also do tips and warning boxes and such like this:

TIP: Tip.

IMPORTANT: This is important.

WARNING: This is a warning.

CAUTION: Tread lightly.

If you need to embed source code, you can do so from external files
like this:

[c]
source~~~~
include::include/hello.c[]
source~~~~

=== Source Code Highlighting

Or you can put the code directly in the file, like this.

[source,python]
if n < 0: print 'Hello World!'

=== Splitting up the book

Now, if you prefer to write so that each chapter is in a seperate file,
which is probably a good idea, you can instead have each chapter as 
another file and then simply add include lines in this file.  Here is
what including another chapter looks like:
