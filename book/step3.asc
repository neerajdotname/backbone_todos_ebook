== step 3 : show tool tip 

If user start typing on the todo input box and if after entering something if the user waits for more than one second then a tooltip should be shown.

Here is a minimal Backbone.js application. This application does not do anything meaningful ,yet, nonetheless it is a valid application.

[source,javascript]
$(function(){
  window.AppView = Backbone.View.extend({});
  window.app = new AppView;
});

=== Explanation

There is a lot going on in this step. First lets look at _events_ stuff.

[source,javascript]
events: {
  "keyup #new-todo": "showTooltip"
}

Above code could be read as when keyup event occurs at #new-todo then invoke function "showTooltip". When todos.js is loaded then backbone will look at events code and will do the necessary work to do proper event bindings. However backbone needs a context to which the events will be bound. And to get that context backbone looks for key _el_. Hence you will notice following code.

[source,javascript]
el: $("#todoapp")


In the jQuery world we are used to doing DOM manipulation with preceding the call with _this_. However in backbone you will see a lot of code like this

[source,javascript]
initialize: function(){
  this.input = this.$("#new-todo");
}

Get used to writing "this.$()" instead of just "$()" . That is because of the way backbone is architected. Inside the view, code is not being executed in the context of "window".

Last but not the least you will notice method _initialize_ . As the name suggests before any method is invoked initialize is invoked. Any prepatory code should be put here.

If you enter something in the todo input box and wait for 1 second then you will see toolship as shown in the picture below.
