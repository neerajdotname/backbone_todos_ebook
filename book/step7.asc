=== Explanation

When a new todo item is created and added to the collection then collection fires an event called _add_. In this commit a callback function named _addOne_ is being added. When a new item is added to the collection then this callback is fired.

In the following code the third argument is specifying what should be the value of _this_ inside the function _addOne_ .

[source,javascript]
Todos.bind('add', this.addOne, this);
