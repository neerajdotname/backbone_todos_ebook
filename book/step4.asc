== step 4 : capture event when enter is hit 

After typing the todo task the user is expected to hit enter to save the task. In this step we wil try to just capture the event.

=== Explanation

In this commit function _createOnEnter_ is invoked everytime a key is pressed. However we are only interested when _enter_ key is pressed and e.keyCode value for _enter_ is 13. 

[source,javascript]
createOnEnter: function(e) {
  if (e.keyCode != 13) return;
  console.log("add functionality to save the todo item");
  this.input.val('');
}
