=== Explanation

This commit adds the feature of editing and updating a todo item by double clicking on an existing todo item. Most of the changes are straight fotward. I want to draw your attention to following code.


[source,javascript]
this.input.bind('blur', _.bind(this.close, this));

In the above code while binding we had to use *_bind* method provided by underscore to maintain the value of this. In this case following code would not work because providing _this_ as the third argument only works while binding to backbone events.

[source,javascript]
this.input.bind('blur', this.close, this);
