== step 5 : capture event when enter is hit 

After typing the todo task the user is expected to hit enter to save the task. In this step we wil try to just capture the event.

=== Code diff

=== Explanation

When a user hits enter after entering a todo item then that todo item needs to be stored. Here that todo item is acting like a model. So this is a good item to create that model and then we will be able to save that model easily. A collection is nothing else but a collection of models.

=== model code

Below code is creating a model named _Todo_ . Backbone automatically invokes method _initialize_ where if the model does not have any content then a default content is being set.

[source,javascript]
window.Todo = Backbone.Model.extend({
  defaults: {
    content: "empty todo ..."
  },
  initialize: function(){
    if (!this.get('content')){
      this.set({"content": this.defaults.content});
    }
  }
});


=== collection code

Here is collection code.

[source,javascript]
window.TodoList = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Todo
});
window.Todos = new TodoList;

After this code _Todos_ will refer to the collection. A backbone collection has certain properties. One of them is method called http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#Collection-create[create] . In order for _crate_ to work collection needs to know which model to work with. Hence the attribute _model_ . If creation of the model is successful then that newly created model will be added to the collection.

If you run the code at this point of time you will get following error


=== Error

[source,javascript]
Uncaught Error: A "url" property of function must be specified


We are getting that error because when model is saved then backbone invokes http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#Sync[Backbone.Sync] which attempts to save the record on the server. Since we have not specified how the model should be saved we are getting the error. We will fix this error in the next step.
