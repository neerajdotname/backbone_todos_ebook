=== Explanation

When user clicks on the image to delete a todo item then function _clear_ is invoked. This function destroys the model. When a model is destroyed then model invokes a callbacks bound to name 'destroy'. In the initialize method an event binding is done such ath when a model is destroyed then _remove_ method is invoked.

In the _remove_ method _this.el_ is used to delete the view fragment. Note that in view _this.el_ refers to the view fragement.
