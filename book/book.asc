== Introduction

http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/[backbone.js] brings MVC style of development to JavaScript. The https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/[source code] of _backbone.js_ has _todos_ application which can be seen in action http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/examples/todos/index.html[here] .

The http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/docs/todos.html[source code of todos] is ,although,  simple might seem intimidating to some. This ebook is my attempt to build the application in 21 incremental steps. First step will have not have any JavaScript code and slowly JavaScript code will be added.

backbone.js is undergoing a lot of change very rapidly. As of this writing backbone.js 0.5.1 was the most stable release and that's what is used in this application.
